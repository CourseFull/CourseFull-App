# CourseFull-App
You have probably either been in or have heard of someone in the situation of trying to figure out what grade they need on a final exam to pass a course. Truth be told, it sucks. 

CourseFull aims to solve that in more ways than one. Not only does it give students a way of easily calculating the grade they need to achieve their goals, it also lets them set goals early on, track deadlines, and even share thoughts and ideas with their classmates - that last one is only 50% done, we did not have time to finish it up.

## How it Works
Starting at their profile, users can set a goal they want to achieve for the current semester. Then, go into the Hubs page to start adding Hubs, Courses, and Components. As users track their grades, CourseFull will give them feedback and let them know how they're doing on their overall grades, as well as insights into which courses have them doing really well or struggling with. Additionally, CourseFull will give users a target to work towards for the remainder of the semester, which will be reflected in their profile and each individual component. This is just an average, so users can decide which courses might have higher or lower targets. They can also see deadlines right from their profile, so they always know what's coming up. 

## Hubs, Courses, Components
Think of Hubs as being your semesters. In each Hub, there are several Courses, and in each Course, there are several Components. Components are your assignments, tutorials, exams, essays, anything that counts for marks. Components are weighted out of 100%, and each given a grade. Once you enter in a grade, CourseFull will mark the assignment as being complete, and adjust your target accordingly. Whether you hit the target or not or are almost there, CourseFull will let you know.

## Groups
Studying is rarely a solo affair. CourseFull lets you connect with classmates easily. Make a group chat with your classmates or anyone on the platform, and start firing off ideas, notes, whatever you need!
